The C++ modules are a series of projects that introduce the basics of object-oriented programming and help us transition from C to C++. They cover topics like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and memory management.

Each module builds on the previous one, slowly adding more complex concepts and best practices for writing clean, efficient code. I haven’t completed all of them yet, but they’ve already given me a strong foundation in modern C++ programming.
